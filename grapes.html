	<p>
		Grape plants, fruit-bearing vines from the Vitis genus of the Vitaceae family, have been with us so long that fossilized leaves, stems, and seeds have been found in Northern hemisphere deposits from the Neogene and Paleogene periods, which cover a stretch of time between 2.6 million and 65 million years ago. Their colorful globe-like, juicy, sugary berries are what we call grapes, whether they come in blue, purple, red, pink, green, or amber. (1)Grape cultivation began as early as 6500 B.C. Propelled by winemaking — the fermentation of grape juice into an alcoholic beverage — by 4000 B.C., cultivation had spread from Eastern Europe and Western Asia into the Nile delta region, after which the practice moved westward into Europe and eastward into China.
